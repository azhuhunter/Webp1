		</div class=poem>
		DARK Angel, with thine aching lust <br>
		To rid the world of penitence: <br>
		Malicious Angel, who still dost <br>
		My soul such subtile violence! <br> <br>

		Because of thee, no thought, no thing, <br>
		Abides for me undesecrate: <br>
		Dark Angel, ever on the wing, <br>
		Who never reachest me too late! <br> <br>

		When music sounds, then changest thou <br>
		Its silvery to a sultry fire: <br>
		Nor will thine envious heart allow <br>
		Delight untortured by desire. <br> <br>

		Through thee, the gracious Muses turn, <br>
		To Furies, O mine Enemy! <br>
		And all the things of beauty burn <br>
		With flames of evil ecstasy. <br> <br>

		Because of thee, the land of dreams <br>
		Becomes a gathering place of fears: <br>
		Until tormented slumber seems <br>
		One vehemence of useless tears. <br> <br>

		When sunlight glows upon the flowers, <br> 
		Or ripples down the dancing sea: <br>
		Thou, with thy troop of passionate powers, <br>
		Beleaguerest, bewilderest, me. <br> <br>

		Within the breath of autumn woods, <br>
		Within the winter silences: <br>
		Thy venomous spirit stirs and broods, <br>
		O Master of impieties! <br> <br>

		The ardour of red flame is thine, <br>
		And thine the steely soul of ice: <br>
		Thou poisonest the fair design <br>
		Of nature, with unfair device. <br> <br>

		Apples of ashes, golden bright; <br>
		Waters of bitterness, how sweet! <br>
		O banquet of a foul delight, <br>
		Prepared by thee, dark Paraclete! <br> <br>

		Thou art the whisper in the gloom, <br>
		The hinting tone, the haunting laugh: <br>
		Thou art the adorner of my tomb, <br>
		The minstrel of mine epitaph. <br> <br>

		I fight thee, in the Holy Name! <br>
		Yet, what thou dost, is what God saith: <br>
		Tempter! should I escape thy flame, <br>
		Thou wilt have helped my soul from Death: <br> <br>

		The second Death, that never dies, <br>
		That cannot die, when time is dead: <br>
		Live Death, wherein the lost soul cries, <br>
		Eternally uncomforted. <br> <br>

		Dark Angel, with thine aching lust! <br>
		Of two defeats, of two despairs: <br>
		Less dread, a change to drifting dust, <br>
		Than thine eternity of cares. <br> <br>

		Do what thou wilt, thou shalt not so, <br>
		Dark Angel! triumph over me: <br>
		Lonely, unto the Lone I go; <br>
		Divine, to the Divinity. <br>
